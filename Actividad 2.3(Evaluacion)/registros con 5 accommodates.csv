A few years later, I opened  Peaks Lodge, a mountain retreat and restaurant in Revelstoke, BC. I spent 10 years taking guests into the back-country on skiing and snowmobile tours. My strong passion for the ocean brought me back to the Island. I then decided  to open The Corbett Guest Suites and Adventures where I chose to bring fun and work together. Sharing my favorite hobbies with the house guests, activities such as bicycling, sailing, kayaking, fishing and crabbing are offered to anyone interested. Many other attractions and services are available in the near by area.

Although we both  grew up in the big cities, we enjoy the country life style and comfort of our home with lovely two  cats, Mister and Lizka.  

Our property is a 3 minute drive to Ganges yet it is away from the main road in a peaceful setting. The herb garden outside of the suite offers our guests fresh ingredients for their culinary needs.  If you have an eye for detail, you will notice a tasteful touch in the interior design of the suite done by Bruce . We value the privacy of our guests by having their own entrance, an outside picnic area with the barbecue  and their own driveway.  

One of the many aspects that drew us to this property,  is the 90 million year old conglomerate that was once an under ocean landslide. The entire acre is seated firmly on the rock featuring fascinating encapsulated clasts of quartz and granite. This background  is constantly inspiring the creativity in us manifesting in continuous evolution of additional adornments via mosaics,  woodwork and landscape ideas.

A few years later, I opened  Peaks Lodge, a mountain retreat and restaurant in Revelstoke, BC. I spent 10 years taking guests into the back-country on skiing and snowmobile tours. My strong passion for the ocean brought me back to the Island. I then decided  to open The Corbett Guest Suites and Adventures where I chose to bring fun and work together. Sharing my favorite hobbies with the house guests, activities such as bicycling, sailing, kayaking, fishing and crabbing are offered to anyone interested.

Having recently moved to Victoria after living abroad for many years, our love of travel has taken us on journey's in many countries and has given us a better understanding of the diverse cultures in our world. 
My favorite destinations so far have been New York, Patagonia, Margarita Island, Rome and I have to admit that I am in love with Victoria BC. This city has so much to offer! I am fascinated with the architecture of the houses, it is a pleasure just to drive around and see the different styles of houses in the many different neighbourhoods. 
As you know we are surrounded by the ocean and we are ocean goers! We love to spend time aboard our boat exploring the Gulf Islands, crab, salmon fishing, or just relaxing on some remote beach as the kids paddle their kayak. Summers here on the island are magical! 
One of my passions is interior design, this combined with Barry's creativity and skills we have managed to create this little oasis in the middle of the city.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see. Or simply do nothing for extended periods of time, but sit quietly and listen to the ocean.  All of the cottages are privately owned and decorated to the taste of the owners.

We are lucky to spent a lot of time in beautiful Sooke because Eoghan works from home and Maitreyi travels as a flight attendant. 

We love traveling, hiking and living. Our favourite way to travel is to setup a base where we can meet the locals and explore the area. We love AirBNB for this! We have stayed at some incredible places, met some amazing people and formed great memories! 

A Bit About Us
Eoghan got his start as a photographer and filmmaker carrying too much camera equipment on wilderness trips to some of the remote places in the world. Over the past decade, many adventures have followed in some of the amazing places on this earth including a solar powered filming trek across the Zanskar region of India, a double helicopter evacuation in 96 hours from Baffin Island and documenting multiple marathon cycling journeys across Canada and the United States.

Eoghan believes that photographs and imagery of large places and scenes should be reproduced as large as possible. His panoramic fine art prints have exhibited at galleries in the Vancouver area as well as at juried events in Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver. His art prints adorn personal and commercial spaces as far away as Japan and Ireland and can be found throughout Sooke Mountain House.

Maitreyi is a born traveler. Since as long as she can remember she has always kept one bag packed and one eye open for the next memory. She works for one of Canada's airlines and has been fortunate enough to explore many parts of the world.",,,100%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/8ec539a2-a0af-463a-b3fa-acc4296fc9e7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/8ec539a2-a0af-463a-b3fa-acc4296fc9e7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,1,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,Neighborhood highlights,Sooke,Sooke,48.40166,-123.69303,Entire home,Entire home/apt,14,,2 baths,4.0,,"[""Indoor fireplace: wood-burning"", ""Conditioner"", ""Ocean view"", ""Bed linens"", ""Ceiling fan"", ""Garden view"", ""Pocket wifi"", ""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Whirlpool stainless steel electric stove"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Hot water"", ""Game console"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Fast wifi \u2013 313 Mbps"", ""Pets allowed"", ""Coffee"", ""Sea view"", ""Harbor view"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Dining table"", ""Shower gel"", ""Private patio or balcony"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Exterior security cameras on property"", ""Private hot tub"", ""Yamaha 5.1 AV surround system sound system with Bluetooth and aux"", ""Pack \u2019n play/Travel crib"", ""Portable fans"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Hammock"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Bathtub"", ""Barbecue utensils"", ""Bay view"", ""Essentials"", ""Body soap"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Clothing storage: walk-in closet, closet, wardrobe, and dresser"", ""Cleaning products"", ""First aid kit"", ""Children\u2019s dinnerware"", ""Baking sheet"", ""EV charger - level 2"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Iron"", ""Coffee maker: drip coffee maker, Keurig coffee machine"", ""Freezer"", ""Kitchen"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Ethernet connection"", ""Mountain view"", ""84 inch HDTV with Chromecast, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video"", ""Heating"", ""Private backyard \u2013 Not fully fenced"", ""Books and reading material"", ""Board games"", ""Self check-in"", ""Shampoo"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Microwave"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Private entrance"", ""Oven"", ""Lockbox"", ""Valley view"", ""Toaster"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Hangers""]",,3,30,3,3,1125,1125,3.0,1125.0,,t,0,0,0,2,2024-11-30,35,4,0,2019-05-20,2024-08-11,5.0,5.0,4.97,5.0,5.0,4.97,4.83,,f,1,1,0,0,0.52

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see. Or simply do nothing for extended periods of time, but sit quietly and listen to the ocean.  All of the cottages are privately owned and decorated to the taste of the owners.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see.

I guess being Island  born (Prince Edward Island) explains why I am so drawn to the ocean..... and this ocean doesn't freeze!   My family moved to Calgary for the  booming economy in 2003. Once I finished high school, I moved to Victoria because I love kiteboarding and spent quite a bit of time in Victoria riding my bike for training camps with my team. There are many great cycling routes and paths to explore.  Whether it be the dense forest, vast ocean, rugged mountains, or vibrant city, Victoria offers everything I admire in a place to call my home. I look forward to sharing my knowledge of the city, whether you are returning to Victoria for business or vacation, or coming for the first time.

Salt Spring became a frequently visited island to continue to explore the outdoors and take a break from the whirlwind of city life.  Salt Spring is home to many fond memories of family and friends and I am grateful to be able to have this sanctuary to share.

Working in the healthcare industry for many years as a nurse, I am committed to healing and health in a very holistic way.  My home on Salt Spring offers this holistic approach to health and wellness. The calm waves of the ocean, the serenity of the sunsets, the freshness of the forests bring a mindful and present state of being.  I am also a new Kundalini yoga instructor and teach classes in the newly renovated studio on the property.  Guests are welcome to drop in to yoga classes when scheduled.

And if you need a dose of action, Ganges is a short hop away to pick up groceries, take in the Saturday market, take a yoga class or shop at the many galleries.  

It is all here!

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see. Or simply do nothing for extended periods of time, but sit quietly and listen to the ocean.  All of the cottages are privately owned and decorated to the taste of the owners.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see. Or simply do nothing for extended periods of time, but sit quietly and listen to the ocean.  All of the cottages are privately owned and decorated to the taste of the owners.

We first came to Quadra Island in 1989, loved the environment and immediately purchased our vacant ocean front property the same day after which construction of the main cabin began. The natural environment is so varied that there is always something inspiring to do, see, hear, feel and taste - see the general description section for more in this respect.

I love meeting new people and  take pride and pleasure in introducing guests to the joys of this island but am sensitive to our visitors' needs around privacy and down time. 

I enjoy seeking out unique and comfortable accommodation when I travel and endeavour to incorporate these qualities into your stay on Quadra. I consider myself an approachable, gracious and generous host but not intrusive.

Relationships are very important to me and I love spending time with family and friends.  I am a voracious reader - my most prized possession is my library card. Cooking (and eating) are also amongst my greatest pleasures.

Simplicity in life is what I strive for and I believe that most of what makes us truly happy doesn't cost very much. 

I look forward to hosting you and trust you will enjoy what Quadra Island and our cottage have to offer.
