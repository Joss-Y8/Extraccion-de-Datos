They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see.

I raised our kids here, and now get to enjoy it with my 10 grandchildren (who are the best part of my life!)  

I moved onto Solid Rock Acres 30 years ago, and built this dream home with family in 2008.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see. Or simply do nothing for extended periods of time, but sit quietly and listen to the ocean.  All of the cottages are privately owned and decorated to the taste of the owners.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see. Or simply do nothing for extended periods of time, but sit quietly and listen to the ocean.  All of the cottages are privately owned and decorated to the taste of the owners.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see. Or simply do nothing for extended periods of time, but sit quietly and listen to the ocean.  All of the cottages are privately owned and decorated to the taste of the owners.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see. Or simply do nothing for extended periods of time, but sit quietly and listen to the ocean.  All of the cottages are privately owned and decorated to the taste of the owners.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see. Or simply do nothing for extended periods of time, but sit quietly and listen to the ocean.  All of the cottages are privately owned and decorated to the taste of the owners.

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see. Or simply do nothing for extended periods of time, but sit quietly and listen to the ocean.  All of the cottages are privately owned and decorated to the taste of the owners.  We invite you to check them  out and are excited to share this special place with you.",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/7ec3f4f6-d7e3-4fa0-9dc1-6745e9761b11.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/7ec3f4f6-d7e3-4fa0-9dc1-6745e9761b11.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Beach Camp,37,44,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,Neighborhood highlights,Juan de Fuca,Juan de Fuca,48.5552,-124.41592,Entire cabin,Entire home/apt,4,1.0,1 bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Conditioner"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Pets allowed"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Bathtub"", ""TV"", ""Essentials"", ""Body soap"", ""Hair dryer"", ""First aid kit"", ""Indoor fireplace"", ""Sauna"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Kitchen"", ""Self check-in"", ""Keypad"", ""Shampoo"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Private entrance"", ""Wifi"", ""Hangers"", ""Heating""]",$187.00,2,1125,2,2,999,999,2.0,999.0,,t,22,51,78,353,2024-11-29,1,1,0,2024-09-08,2024-09-08,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,t,37,37,0,0,0.36

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it.

They were looking for a business they could call their own and benefit from all their hard work and ideas instead of seeing CEO’s and upper office management always reaping the rewards, while telling other managers and workers they needed to cut back, or there were no bonuses for the year. 

The journey here was not easy - they spent 6 months apart while trying to sell their house in Saskatchewan, and then in late April 2021 they got some wonderful news - their current tenant insurer in BC said they would cover a landlord policy for a house in SK. 

In May 2021 Ken gave away or had to throw away 98% of the household items they had collected over the years - since they were moving from a huge house in SK just over 3000 sq ft with an extra wide 2 car garage into a less than 650 sq. Ft basement suite in BC. 

The transition of purchasing Handsome Dan’s and moving halfway across the country during a pandemic none the less wasn’t the easiest but they got through and now they are excited to expand and build Handsome Dan’s vacation rental property management in Port Renfrew and across the island to help cottage owners see a return on their investment, and for guests to have an amazing experience from the time they book their vacation till the time they leave; and even after raving about the experience they had at a Handsome Dan property. 

Port Renfrew is a favourite destination for a day or overnight trip on Vancouver Island. Each visit, no matter what time of year you are consumed by the natural majesty of this little community and the breath taking earthly beauty that surrounds it. 

We invite you to stay in our cottages and enjoy a few days, or weeks any time of the year. There is much to do and see. Or simply do nothing for extended periods of time, but sit quietly and listen to the ocean.  All of the cottages are privately owned and decorated to the taste of the owners.
